# Shit, you weren't supposed to find this

Well, since you're here, kick back and explore. This is just another place for me to procrastinate before I have to do actual work.

You can find the actual website at https://mirai-miki.com

## What's the deal?

Think of this as your one-stop shop for all things Mirai-Miki. You'll find links to my GitHub, where I've occasionally been known to code. There's also a portal to my Discord community, Mirai Lounge, where you can contact me if you absolutely must.

If you're more of a visual person, check out my Instagram and Cara profiles. I've been creating digital art and 3D models that might just blow your mind (or at least your screen).

## Why should you care?

Well, you shouldn't. This isn't anything fancy. But if you're curious then have at it and don't say I didn't warn you.

## A few random thoughts:

- Cats are superior to dogs. (Fight me.)
- Tea is essential for survival. (No exceptions.)

## Under the Hood:

- **Built with:** Gatsby.js for a blazing-fast experience.
- **Powered by:** Mantine 7 for a sleek and modern UI.
- **Hosted on:** Cloudflare Pages for global reach and easy deployment.

## Need to contact me?

God help you if it has come to this. But if the world is about to end and you really need to, you can find a link to my Discord server.
